          For most Codecademy course material, we are given an in-browser development
          environment to practice concepts that were just taught. But occasionally we
          are directed to build an exercise off the Codecademy learning platform. This
          is my collection of exercises from various courses under Codecademy's
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css" target="_blank">HTML & CSS</a>
          umbrella of courses.

              <h2><a href="./dasmotos-arts/" target="_blank">Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts</a></h2>
              An art shop landing page as an exercise for the
              <i>Intro to Local Website Development</i> chapter of the
              <i><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites" target="_blank">
                Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages</a></i>
              skill path. We are given the images to use and a
              <a href="./dasmotos-arts/dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg" target="_blank">specification</a>
              that requires practicing fundamental HTML and CSS.

              <h2><a href="./tea-cozy/" target="_blank">Tea Cozy</a></h2>
              A tea shop landing page as an exercise for the
              <i><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css-flexbox-and-grid" target="_blank">
                Learn CSS: Flexbox and Grid</a></i>
              course. We are given the images to use (including the top-left logo)
              and a
              <a href="./tea-cozy/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg" target="_blank">
                specification
              </a>
              that requires using
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox" target="_blank">
                CSS flexbox
              </a>
              for a proper layout that dynamically reacts to window size.

              <h2><a href="./excursion/" target="_blank">Excursion</a></h2>
              A phone app landing page as an exercise for the
              <i>Git and Publishing to GitHub Pages</i> section of the
              <i><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites" target="_blank">
                Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages</a></i>
              skill path. We are given images and a video to use plus two
              specifications showing 
              <a href="./excursion/resources/excursion.png" target="_blank">how it should look</a>
              and
              <a href="./excursion/resources/excursion_redline.png" target="_blank">styling details</a>
              that must be present. The primary intent is to establish familiarity with
              publishing via GitHub Pages.

              <h2><a href="./colmar-academy/" target="_blank">Colmar Academy</a></h2>
              An educational institution landing page as capstone project for the
              <i><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites" target="_blank">
                Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages</a></i>
              skill path. We are given images and a video to use plus a
              <a href="./colmar-academy/colmar-academy-spec.png" target="_blank">single wireframe</a>
              with only partially specified details. We are left to
              fill in the gaps at our discretion. The primary intent of this
              project is to establish our design sense and make good
              judgements in the face of ambiguity. An extra challenge was added
              with the fact it required using media queries to switch between
              desktop and mobile views, and it is up to us to decide on
              appropriate breakpoints and how layout will dynamically
              change to suit.
