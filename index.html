          For most Codecademy course material, we are given an in-browser development
          environment to practice concepts that were just taught. But occasionally we
          are directed to build an exercise off the Codecademy learning platform. This
          is my collection of exercises from various courses under Codecademy's
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css" target="_blank">HTML & CSS</a>
          umbrella of courses.

              <h2><a href="./tea-cozy/">Tea Cozy</a></h2>
              A tea shop landing page as an exercise for the
              <i><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css-flexbox-and-grid" target="_blank">
                Learn CSS: Flexbox and Grid</a></i>
              course. We are given the images to use (including the top-left logo)
              and a
              <a href="./tea-cozy/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg" target="_blank">
                specification
              </a>
              that requires using
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox" target="_blank">
                CSS flexbox
              </a>
              for a proper layout that dynamically reacts to window size.
