# Codecademy HTML (& friends) Exercises
This repository hosts my exercises projects assigned by Codecademy courses
in HTML & related (CSS, JavaScript, etc) technologies. The results are
hosted via GitHub Pages so I could view results from any web capable device
by visiting https://roger-random.github.io/codecademy_html/

## Licensing
I do not know Codecademy's licensing policy on this material. While I'm happy
to release my own work under the permissive MIT license in other repositories,
this repository has a lot of Codecademy content. Yes, they tell students like
me to do these exercises off Codecademy's own platform, but that's not the
same as freely releasing material. I don't think I can say "MIT License" on
this specific repository.
